There are two directories in this repository- Analysis, and Presentation.

In the Analysis directory, there is a subdirectory called Data.
Data subdirectory holds two additional directories- file_CSV and file_Rgathering

The file_CSV subdirectory will contain two CSV files of our data collected
#Indian.csv
#Chinese.csv

The file_Rgathering subdirectory will contain two R files used in getting our data
#indianGathering.R
#chineseGathering.R

For the Data- Obtain section of our OSEMN project the Analysis/Data directory will
contain all the required code that was used in the section. 

Also in the Analysis directory is a plot1.R file which contains all the codes required
to reading the two CSV files and scrubbing the data for statistical use. 

The presentation directory contains a two files and a folder. The RNW file in this folder
is the Latex file of our OSEMN project. The PDF file is also a document for our complete
report of the OSEMN project tutorial for using the Yelp API.
